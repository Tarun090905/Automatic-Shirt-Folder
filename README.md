# Automatic-Shirt-Folder

The Automatic Shirt Folder project uses an Arduino board to automate shirt folding. Ultrasonic sensors detect the shirt’s presence and orientation, while the Arduino controls the folding mechanism to ensure neat folds. This project highlights Arduino’s potential in household automation.

**Components**\
Arduino Uno (microcontroller)\
Servo Motors (for folding arms)\
Ultrasonic Sensors (for shirt positioning)\
Push Buttons (for start/reset)\
MDF/Plastic Sheet Frame (for structure)

**Features**\
Automated sequential folding\
Compact and cost-effective design\
Easy-to-use control interface
